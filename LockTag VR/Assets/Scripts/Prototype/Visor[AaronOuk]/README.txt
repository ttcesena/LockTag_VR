The visor script is used for the player to "equip" the visor on the players head.
The script sets the object to false.

	Attach the visor script to the desired object. Make sure you also attach VRTK_ChildOfControllerGrabAttach and VRTK_SwapControllerGrabAction scripts to
the object as well.

	Make sure to set Valid Drop to 'Drop Valid Snap Drop Zone'.

	When adding the Snap Drop Zone, go to the VRTK prefabs folder and attach to the camera head.

	IMPORTANT. Make sure to attach the object into the 'Highlight Object Prefab' in the Snap Drop Zone script.
